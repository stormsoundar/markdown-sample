As of today, April 19, every U.S. adult is eligible to get a COVID vaccine. Please, get your COVID vaccine. Please. Do it now.

Coronavirus cases are going up in my hospital. They are going up in my county. They are going up in my state. They are going up all across the country. This is most likely due to the B.1.1.7 variant, the so-called “UK variant,” and it is wreaking havoc across the United States.

Please. Get. Your. Vaccine.

And you know what? The patients who are getting admitted to our hospital, and getting admitted to our ICU, and getting very sick are much, much younger (between 20s and 50s, for the most part). And you know what? The ones who are also dying are much younger as well.

Please. Get. Your. Vaccine.

This is not the time to let down our guard. We are in an extremely tight race with the mutant virus, and in many places across our country — and the world, in fact — the virus is winning that race. We need to get vaccinated as fast as possible and keep up with masking, social distancing, hand washing, and avoiding large gatherings.

[As of now](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/19/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases#adults-eligible-covid-vaccine), half of all U.S. adults have received one dose of a vaccine, and about 84.3 million people have been fully vaccinated. We are making great progress. We just need a little bit longer, and hopefully we can beat this virus once and for all.

That takes everyone — all of us — to work together with masks, social distancing, hand washing, and the like. There is also one more thing:

Please. Get. Your. Vaccine.
