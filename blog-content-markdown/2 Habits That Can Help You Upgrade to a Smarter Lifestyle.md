A smarter lifestyle can do more for your life and career than you can ever imagine. Einstein was a genius. He devoted a significant part of his life to looking for answers about our universe.

Leonardo Da Vinci was a genius. He spent most of his life wandering the possibilities of the human mind.

Simone de Beauvoir was a great philosopher. She was a famous existentialist and a true intellectual.

Truly genius minds embrace the smart lifestyle — they learn from other brilliant minds, question conventional wisdom, think for themselves, maintain intellectual curiosity throughout their careers.

Embracing the smart lifestyle means you are prepared to let go of first-order thinking — living without questioning fundamental assumptions about life and living it. It means you want something deeper in life. It also means want to become a better version of yourself.

These are two powerful ways to improve how you live, think, decide and work. Learning to embrace these habits can accelerate your personal growth.

### Practice selective reading

> Francis Bacon was right, “Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few are to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention.”

No matter how basic this habit may sound, reading is still one of the most powerful ways to improve your intellect, even if you read a few paragraphs every day.

“In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time — none, zero. You’d be amazed at how much Warren reads–and at how much I read.” Charlie Munger said.

High-level thinkers don’t pay attention to every content. They aim to read something new every day but choose their sources of knowledge carefully.

Some ideas are meant to be studied slowly and thoughtfully. Not every book or content deserves your attention if you want to accelerate your learning.

For a smarter lifestyle, read something new every day but choose your content carefully. And don’t just read ideas or content you agree with. Find thoughts that contradict your assumptions, and then think deeper about all of them.

`“The reading of all good books is like conversation with the finest men of past centuries.” ― René Descartes`

Read great books on curious topics you usually ignore — don’t just read content that will reinforce your assumptions, perceptions and thoughts. It pays to get out of your worldview to broaden your knowledge.

Wise people embrace diverse mental perspectives. “You become knowledgeable by reading. You become strong by doing. You become wise by thinking.” Maxime Lagacé said.

To retain more of what you learn, slow down and make time for reflection and independent thinking. By making time for selective and deep learning, you improve your chances of clarifying your thoughts.

Your time is limited, be selective about what you consume online. Focus on information that can advance your life, career or intellectual pursuits.

### Aim to be a little wiser today than you were yesterday

> “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Day by day, and at the end of the day-if you live long enough-like most people, you will get out of life what you deserve.” — Charles T. Munger

Never go to bed without learning something new.

Every new idea, assumption, mental model, or knowledge you come across stimulates your brain and improve your cognitive skills.

If you aim to go to bed wiser than than you were yesterday, your new knowledge will accumulate to serve you when you need it.

Many people stick to the same thinking patterns, behaviours and mindsets, but a more brilliant you tomorrow largely depends on embracing new ideas from multiple sources.

And finally remember what Confucius said, “No matter how busy you may think you are, you must find time for reading, or surrender yourself to self-chosen ignorance.”
