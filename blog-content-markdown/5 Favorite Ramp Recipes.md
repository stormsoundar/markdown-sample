Well folks, it’s that time of year again when tables across America are besieged by mounds of garlicky wild ramps. Both Chefs and home cooks alike are running rampant (pardon the pun) with their creations. In Vermont, I walk past endless fields of wild ramps stretching out as far as my eye can see.

Ramps, also known as wild leeks, wild garlic, or forest garlic are the country’s favorite wild foraged food. Using ramps at home is quite easy as they are extremely versatile, and lend themselves easily to almost any dish.

Last night, the wife and I dug out our jar of ramp vodka from the liquor cabinet and decided to make a spring cocktail honoring this wild allium.

## 1. Ramp Vodka

This recipe is so simple it requires only a few words. Stuff three or four ramps into a clean jar. Top with vodka, screw the top on, and wait two weeks. Then make yourself a delicious Ramp Bloody Mary.
