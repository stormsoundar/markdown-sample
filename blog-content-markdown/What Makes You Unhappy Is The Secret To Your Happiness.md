What makes you unhappy?

For centuries, great minds have been searching for answers to human happiness. But not many people take time to understand what makes them miserable.

There are many unhappy people in the world. Knowledge and a deeper understanding of what drives you insane or make you sad can help you find experiences that make you happy.

The more you understand yourself, your unhappy experiences and behaviours that bring out the worst in you, the more you can shift and focus on activities that make you happy.

> The greatest happiness is to know the source of unhappiness. Fyodor Dostoevsky said.

Too many people focus on finding happiness. It’s the wrong pursuit. Making happiness a goal doesn’t work, and more often than not, you will end up miserable. It’s an ultimate illusion. You will waste a lot of time you could have invested in activities that can contribute to a meaningful life.

“We create our own unhappiness. The purpose of suffering is to help us understand we are the ones who cause it.” Willie Nelson once said.

You can quickly improve your sources of happiness if you understand what brings out the worst in you. The clues are hidden in your daily patterns, habits and behaviours. The life you have built for yourself is either making miserable or happy.

> Behavioural patterns of unhappiness include social isolation, consistent inactivity, thinking about everything worst in your life all the time, worrying about events you can’t control, negative narratives about your life, among others. Does any of these sound familiar? These everyday habits are common among many unhappy people.

People who want to find happiness in the future tend to overthink what could make them happy and waste the present. That mind wandering habit can make you unhappy.

When you convince yourself that you will happy at some point in the future, you effectively stop living your present life. It’s a happiness denial in the present that makes you miserable.

Looking into the future for happiness is an illusion that robs you of your present life. The desire for happiness out there or in the future can ruin the life you have right now.

**Don’t get stuck in the future; learn to appreciate the present.**

When you stop sacrificing today for a happier tomorrow, you will start living a more fulfilling life. Don’t use the future to hide from the present.

“When you go through life with preferences but don’t let your happiness depend on any one of them, then you’re awake.” Anthony de Mello said.

No matter what life you have right now, finding things to be grateful for (no matter how small) now can improve your mood and happiness.

**The easiest path to a happy life requires a deep and comprehensive examination of your life.** And most importantly, a change of behaviours that consistently stress you out causes anxiety or misery.

You can build and cultivate happiness in almost everything you do. It’s a daily practice. And you can get better at it like any other skill. You can embrace activities, experiences, and habits that make life meaningful every day.

An important habit for a happy life to make time for better connections. “Studies consistently show that our own happiness is linked with the happiness of others,” [writes](https://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/how-to-be-happy) By Tara Parker-Pope The New York Times.

Choose your connections or social relationships carefully, though, because emotion is contagious. Happy people are more likely to make you happy too.

**If you want to find your happy place at work, learn to make it less boring.** Find purpose at work. Or better still, get a job that brings out the best in you.

If your job doesn’t make you happy, but you can’t quit your job for a satisfying one, find a side project you are curious about.

Something that gives you a sense of meaning. Once you find that, commit a few minutes of your time every week to improve it or build it.

And finally, **invest money in memorable experiences**. How you spend money can determine your level of happiness. Things don’t make people happy. In the end, you will always want more.

Given the option, choose to find, make or buy time more for meaningful experience or activities. Time to do what you are curious about or what you value in life is an easy way to a happy life.
