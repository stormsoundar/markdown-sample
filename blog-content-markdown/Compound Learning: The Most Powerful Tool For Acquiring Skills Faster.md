Compound interest is a powerful principle — a small amount of money can grow into large amounts over time if left alone. If you don’t interfere with the process unnecessarily, you will reap the benefit with time.

In simple terms, it’s interest on interest.

It’s got the snowball effect. As long as it keeps “moving”, it will get bigger — all things being equal. Anyone can benefit from it. Compound interest is why people invest money early in life.

“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn’t, pays for it.” Albert Einstein said.

The compounding principle can be applied to learning.

You can have the same effect. Knowledge begets knowledge. Over time you will become a powerhouse. With enough wisdom about how some things work, you can connect ideas better and use them to your advantage.

The ability to pick up skills over time can change your life.

A relentless learner can accumulate the proper knowledge and skills to become a better person, an indispensable employee and a free thinker.

“The more you try to do and learn things, the more you understand how things work and how to learn better. These insights and reflections are your compound learning,” [writes](https://amist.co/compound-learning/) Alexander Mistakidis.

If you think about learning or acquiring any skill as an investment, you will approach it with an open mind. You will think beyond the immediate benefits and plan on stacking abilities, knowledge, success principles for the future.

People who use the compound principle of learning apply it in almost all areas of their lives. You can stack skills and wisdom for your life.

You can compound knowledge for a better relationship. And of course, you can build a store of knowledge for managing your money.

## Time compounds, learn to create your own snowball effect

> “Read 500 pages every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it,” says Warren Buffett.

`Compound learning is a mindset. Once you embrace compound learning, your brain will find the right connections to apply it in many areas of your life. And eventually, you will begin to gain exponential returns.`

The good news is: you don’t have to hurry the process. You don’t even need many hours every day to apply the compound learning principle in your life.

“The only thing that compounds faster than interest is learning.” Orrin Woodward said.

You can find pockets of time in your busy schedule to start accumulating the right knowledge or skill for your life and career.

##### These are a few steps to get you learning fast:

**1. Identity what you want to learn first.** What’s the one skill you desperately want to learn or add to your set of complementary skills?

As you make progress, choose deeper topics or skills that can complement your core skill.

**2. Once you know that, find the best places you can start learning.** Who is a thought leader in that space? What sites, blogs, podcasts, newsletters and courses offer the best knowledge on the subject?

**3. Schedule learning times on your calendar**. It can be a few minutes after work. Or early morning, just before you start your daily work. You could wake up earlier to do that. You can also read in between deep work. It’s up to you. But make the process enjoyable, otherwise, it will quickly become a struggle, and you will quit.

**4. Start learning fast**. Don’t miss your appointments with yourself. Keep looking for free times for learning. Leverage the snowball effect and keep learning, even if it’s 5 or 10 minutes every day. It still counts.

**5. Make it a part of your routine**, like how you have your breakfast every morning. Plan your learning time into your day. That’s how the skills, habits or knowledge you are acquiring will gradually compound.
