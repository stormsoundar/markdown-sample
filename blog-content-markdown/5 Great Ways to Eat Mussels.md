I love cooking mussels at home because they are both quick and easy to do. Really the ultimate fast food dish. My favorite mussel recipes are a comforting cross between a soup and a hearty hot meal. Once you master the basic preparation, you can easily add a few different ingredients to create your own new variations. Be sure to serve with plenty of toasted bread for dipping into the flavor-packed broth or even try serving with [French Fries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqFPnJV0f2E.&feature=youtu.be).

## How to Clean and Debeard Mussels

It is important to only clean the mussels within an hour of cooking them. Tap any open mussels on the counter to see if they are still alive; discard any that do not immediately close. Soak the mussels in cold water with a sprinkle of salt for 1 hour. Scrub the mussels with a small brush or a paring knife to remove anything that clings to the shell. Pull off the beard that sticks out from between the shells (this is how the mussel clings to rocks and various things in the ocean).

**The Best Moules Marinières: Mussels Sailor Style**

PREP: 5 minutes | COOK: 5 minutes | MAKES: 4 servings

* 4 pounds mussels

* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter

* 2–3 shallots, diced

* 2 cloves garlic, mashed

* 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme

* 2 cups white wine

* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

* Sea salt and freshly

* ground black pepper

1. In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, melt the butter until foamy but not browned. Add the shallots, garlic, and thyme and cook for 2 minutes, or until soft and translucent. Add the white wine and parsley and bring to a rapid boil.

2. Add the mussels, cover, and cook until they open, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the cooked mussels to a large bowl or shallow individual bowls. Discard any with shells that won’t open. Ladle the broth from the top of the pot over the mussels, leaving any grit behind in the pot.

**Note:** A lot of moules marinières recipes online will have cream added. Very tasty BUT this is actually called Moules a la Creme. To make it, just add 1/4 cup of heavy cream along with the wine in Step 1.

## 2. Turmeric Ginger Mussels

PREP: 5 minutes | COOK: 5 minutes | MAKES: 4 servings

I started out desperately wanting to make Mouclade, a curried mussel dish that originated in the French port city of La Rochelle but ended up with a more Asian feeling bowl of turmeric ginger mussels. In some ways, curry and mussels may sound weird together, but the flavor combination is off the hook, especially when backed by coconut milk and hot chili peppers.

* 1 tablespoon coconut oil or butter

* 1 sweet onion chopped

* 1 red pepper sliced

* 2 cloves of garlic mashed

* 2 teaspoons turmeric

* 1/2 teaspoon ginger

* 1 teaspoon curry

* 1 dried hot pepper crushed in your hand (optional)

* 1 can coconut milk

* 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth

* 4 pounds mussels (cleaned and debearded)

* 1/2 cup chopped cilantro

1. In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, melt the coconut oil. Add the onions, pepper, and garlic, and cook for 3 minutes, or until soft and translucent. Add the spices, hot pepper, coconut milk, and stock and bring to a rapid boil.

2. Add the mussels and cilantro, cover, and cook until they open, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the cooked mussels to a large bowl or shallow individual bowls. Discard any with shells that won’t open. Ladle the broth from the top of the pot over the mussels, leaving any grit behind in the pot.
